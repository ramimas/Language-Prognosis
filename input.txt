The amount a teenager sleeps is associated with how likely they are to engage in risky and suicidal behavior, a new study said. 
"Fewer hours of sleep on an average school night [is] associated with increased odds of all selected unsafe behaviors," the 
authors wrote, including risk-taking while driving, such as drunken driving, potentially unsafe sexual activity, aggressive 
behavior and use of alcohol, tobacco and other drugs. Participants' sleep duration was categorized as eight hours or more, 
seven hours, six hours or, less than six hours and then measured against high-risk behaviors, in the study published Monday 
in the journal JAMA Pediatrics. The team found the strongest associations in relation to mood and self-harm. Teens who slept 
for less than six hours per night were three times more likely to report considering suicide, planning a suicide attempt or 
attempting suicide, compared with teens who slept eight hours or more. They were also four times more likely to have reported 
a suicide attempt that resulted in them needing treatment.
